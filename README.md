# Processing Flow Field

I followed Dan Shiffman's awesome Perlin Noise video series and followed along with [this challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjoM9oKOAKY&index=6&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bgPNQAdxQZpJuJCjeOr7VD)
in p5.js. Finding my browser crippled by the drawing complexity, I decided to re-write the sketch in Java for Processing.

[Download Processing](https://processing.org/download/) and open this directory to play around with the Sketch!
